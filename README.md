Rockin' - Created by Scott Emerson

Description

A simple 2D game / simulation prototyping engine. Designed
to be data-driven and (eventually) simple to use at the
expense of scalability. Game objects (CoreEntities), scenes,
and behaviors are all defined by data files and script files.
(Lame project name comes from the Asteroids-like test game
that I've been using to ensure that features are working.)
